# Statistics Projects 

I'm going to use this as a general repo to work through Statistical / Mathematical concepts as I explore them and help other people understand them along the way!

1. The [Logarithm Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/Log_Relationships/Logarithmic%20relationships.ipynb) goes into detail about plotting, generating, and interpreting log relationships using some Hapiness and GDP data I found online. 

2. The [Exponential Growth Notebook](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/Exponential_Growth/Exponential%20Growth.ipynb) explores that type of relationship using earthquake data. 

3. The [SAS Baseball project](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/SAS_Stats_Projects/Baseball.sas) looks at some common data manipulation and plotting techniques in SAS using the test data set ```sashelp.baseball```. Techniques include ```proc sql```, ```proc means```, ```proc sgplot```, ```proc gchart```, ```proc reg```, and ```data``` steps.
